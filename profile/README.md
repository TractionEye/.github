## 🚀 About TractionEye

TractionEye is a decentralized trust management platform built on the TON blockchain that bridges the gap between professional traders and investors. Our protocol enables traders to monetize their expertise by creating and managing investment strategies, while investors can effortlessly grow their wealth by allocating assets into these strategies.
## 🌐 How It Works

1. **Traders** create strategies with few clicks and contribute their own capital
2. **Investors** deposit funds into strategies they like
3. **Traders** manage pooled funds and execute trades for all participants
4. **Profits** are automatically distributed:
   - 75% to investors
   - 20% to trader
   - 5% to the referrers
5. Both traders and investors can claim profits from each trade any time

All processes are governed by audited smart contracts, ensuring that funds can only be used for trading through specified protocols. Our platform provides transparent on-chain performance metrics and works exclusively with trusted DEXes and tokens.
